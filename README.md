# Simple-calculator-
It is a simple calculator which takes 2 numbers as input and add, subtracts, multiplies or divides it as per the user
This Java project is a basic command-line calculator built within the BlueJ IDE. It was developed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by encapsulating basic arithmetic functions—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—into dedicated class methods.

The calculator supports the following functions:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)

This project was built using the following core technologies:
Language: Java
IDE: BlueJ (Tested with JDK 11+)
Concepts Demonstrated: Class instantiation, robust method calls, and basic parameter passing.
